An old Processing game I made with some others during my first year at uni.
Heavily inspired by the game Tiny Wings.

# How to run
Double click the jar in the /dist/ directory or run `java.exe -jar dist/FYS2.jar` in the console.

# Important note
While this appears to be the final build, I no longer have access to the original git history of the project.
For the sake of privacy I've also gone out of my way to remove all the original author names, and replace them accordingly.
This is no way meant to discredit them.
